Some of the homes had large sections of the roofs ripped off while some less well constructed homes (nails instead of bolts) had collapsed walls.  The tornado continued northeast and intensified to EF-4 where several well constructed homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were completely destroyed with the slab swept clean.  Several outbuildings were destroyed along East Hemstock Road and South Center Road.  A residence on East Bethal Road received heavy damage with most of the outer walls collapsing.  The tornado once again intensified to EF-4  near IL-251 and IL-64 where well constructed homes were swept clean off their foundation.  A farmstead just northeast of the aforementioned intersection was also swept clean to the foundation.  A heavy barn was thrown and rolled on East Lindenwood Road.

Peak winds were estimated at 165 mph in Dekalb County, rating this section of the tornado a high end EF-3.  Approximately 71 homes in the community had been damaged, 17 of which had been completely destroyed with all walls collapsed or removed from the buildings.  Some homes that were only nailed to the foundation were swept clean.  Two fatalities and 11 injuries occurred in Fairdale.

Several homes were heavily damaged with large sections of the roofs removed along Wheeler road and dozens of trees were snapped and uprooted.  A few trees were debarked.  The second story was ripped off of a home near the intersection of McNeal Road and Irene Road.  A two-story rebar reinforced cinder block silo was destroyed.

The tree damage suggested EF3 intensity while some debarking was also noted downwind or to the NE of the home.  The structure itself was pull from the sill plate which had bolts every 6 feet per code. however it appears that an initial failure point was the garage door which faced south and the roof was attached to both the garage and main structure so it appears that a catastrophic failure caused the entire structure to be lifted off its foundation and deposited 50-150 yards to the NE of the foundation.  Two cars in the garage were moved only slightly which indicates below EF4 type intensity in this event.

The tornado then moved ESE and then east along a path around 1 mile south of Chapman destroying 1 farmstead and several other homes in the area.  The worst damage was done to a farmstead 1 mile southwest of Chapman along old highway 40 where the home was destroyed and all outbuildings were blown away.  The sub floor of the home was removed from a bolted sill plate and the poured concrete foundation was cracked on the south side exposing the rebar where the strongest forces from the lifting structure occurred as it was being removed and blown away likely occurred.  Much of the brick facade of the home did remain where it fell around the structure however so the area was not swept clean. Winds approaching 200 mph were likely in this area while a woman home at the time took shelter in the basement and was ok with only superficial injuries.

Extensive tree damage occurred and countless homes had minor to major roof damage in the neighborhood south of Hillcrest Loop. As the tornado reached Sun Circle, it intensified to EF3 strength again and caused significant damage to a few homes as well as moderate damage to many homes in the neighborhood. Beyond the subdivision along Sun Circle, the tornado caused tree damage again before reaching Evelyn Gandy|Parkway. It caused structural damage to an AT&T store by lifting the roof of the strip mall. It caused additional roof damage to several homes and a church along the Parkway as well as along Springridge Road and Corinth Road. As the tornado tore across Shawnee Trail, it caused impressive tree damage, which included snapping and uprooting hardwood and softwood trees. As the tornado tracked just south of|HDR Lane, it took down two metal electrical transmission lines. The tornado then destroyed a house along Macedonia Road, as well as causing additional roof to other homes and taking down numerous trees. Additional impressive tree damage occurred along Old Richton Road and Tyroby Lane. The tornado continued to down trees as it|tracked across Old Richton Road into Perry County.

The tornado lifted just east of Abbeville. The tornado caused significant damage along the track, resulting in 5 fatalities in Albany. Severe tree damage was observed along the entire path which was up to 1.2 miles wide. In many spots, 90 to 100 percent of the trees in the path were uprooted or snapped. In Dougherty County, the tornado touched down on Tarva Road. By the time it reached Newton, the tornado was approximately 1.25 miles wide. There was extensive tree damage and some minor to moderate damage to a few homes in this area, consistent with EF2 damage. The tornado moved through the Radium Springs area, destroying nearly every tree in its path and causing EF2 damage to several houses. Most houses in this area had significant damage from falling trees. The tornado then moved through several mobile home parks just west of U.S. 319, destroying many mobile homes and causing the 4 fatalities. Damage consistent with an EF3 tornado was observed just east of U.S. 319. The tornado caused a large portion of a warehouse at the Proctor and Gamble Plant to collapse and tossed several semi-trailers across Mock Road. Additional EF3 damage was observed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, where multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed. In addition, several concrete light poles were snapped near the base, and a large solid concrete building had its solid concrete roof shifted more than 2 inches. A well-built concrete block church on Sylvester Rd was demolished with only parts of a few walls remaining. The estimated wind speed at this point is 150 mph, the highest analyzed along the track. EF3 damage was also observed on Harris Road where a cement block church was destroyed.  Damage estimates exceeded $300 million according to a media article citing the Dougherty County Commissioner.</div>`)[0];

The tornado quickly became violent, reaching EF-4 intensity and leveling five homes just west of Interstate 55, about 3.5 miles northwest of Perryville. Numerous unoccupied cars from a salvage yard were blown into or over Interstate 55. The lone fatality occurred when a southbound vehicle on Interstate 55 was intercepted by the tornado. The victim's pickup truck was tossed into a field at least 100 yards from the interstate. The coroner reported that the victim was thrown from the vehicle and died at the scene. The passenger in the vehicle was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital. The area of greatest home and property destruction was three miles north of Perryville, in the vicinity of U.S. Highway 61. Maximum wind speeds were estimated near 180 mph in the vicinity of Interstate 55 and also near U.S. Highway 61. The damage path showed multiple vortex characteristics with ground striations and scarring to bare ground. At least 100 homes were damaged or destroyed in Perry County, mostly on the northern outskirts of Perryville. Most persons in the tornado's path took shelter in their basements. All twelve tornado injuries occurred in Perry County, where the tornado was at its strongest. At least one couple was trapped in their basement until rescuers removed debris. As the tornado approached the Mississippi River, multiple ground striations were noted in a farm field, indicative of multiple vortices. The maximum path width was over one-half mile shortly before the tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Randolph County, Illinois.</div>`)[0];

Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected. Ten homes were deemed total losses.  The estimated property value losses were estimated at $658,000.</div>`)[0];

The tornado first touched down west of US Highway 431 north of town of Wellington, where it rapidly intensified and widened. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees along US Highway 431. Several homes were damaged by the falling trees. The tornado proceeded eastward across Websters Road and Broughton Road with scattered tree damage. As the tornado crossed Old Sulphur Springs Road, two homes were damaged with scores of trees snapped or uprooted. At Angel Station Road, the tornado filled the valley from one side to the other and caused extensive tree and home damage. An electrical transmission tower line was toppled at this point, but it was believed that flying debris compromised the structure. The tornado continued eastward and destroyed the sanctuary at West Point Baptist Church. Additional structures were severely damaged at the church. The tornado entered the City of Jacksonville where it gained strength into the EF3 category, with winds around 140 mph. It removed most of the roof and the top floor of two buildings in an apartment complex. The tornado affected the entire campus of Jacksonville State University. Several buildings sustained significant damage. The most intense winds remained north of the campus however, mowing down trees and causing direct damage to homes. As the tornado crossed Highway 21, it caused caused major damage to the Merrill Building. It then moved into a highly populated zone, where scores of homes suffered major damage and rendered uninhabitable. The tornado maintained its strength as it crossed Choccolocco Mountain, and winds funneled up the valley uprooting or snapping trees. It caused major damage to a number of homes on the mountainside. Damaged continued all the way up to just south of the peak of the mountain. As the tornado moved down the eastern side of Choccolocco Mountain, it narrowed substantially and became stronger once it reached the valley below. Stands of trees were wiped out with trunks snapped relatively close to ground level. Perhaps the most intense damage along the entire track occurred along Hollingsworth Road, where a site built home was completely destroyed with only a portion of one interior wall left standing. Debris from this home was blown downstream across a field with some evidence of wind rowing. Hay bales adjacent to the home, estimated at 800 pounds each, were thrown up to 300 yards to the east. Maximum winds at this location were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado continued east-southeast and downed thousands of trees in the Talladega National Forest and crossed into Cleburne County just south of County Road 534.</div>`)[0];

The tornado crossed through the independent city of Lynchburg and eventually tracked over the James River into Amherst County at 6:08 PM EST.  This was only the third EF3 tornado to occur in the NWS Blacksburg forecast since 1950, and was the longest track tornado within the state of Virginia for the NWS Blacksburg forecast area. The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon.  A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss.  A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over.  The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive.  Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon.  As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.

It hit a farmstead, destroying 3 barns and severely damaging 4 other out buildings.  The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with maximum wind speeds of 112 mph. The tornado continued moving northeastward, hitting several other outbuildings and snapping trees. The tree and outbuilding damage was classified as EF1 damage with wind speeds of 100-110mph. As the tornado continued to the northeast it snapped more large trees and then hit a log home, removing 25-50% of the roof material. It also snapped many other trees on this property and destroyed a couple of small outbuildings, throwing the debris northward into a field. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with wind speeds of 115mph. The tornado continued northeastward and moved into a wooded area, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees along its path. It then curved north-northeastward and moved into Hewittville, a small community on the southern edge of Taylorville. Here the tornado destroyed or severely damaged multiple houses. The first house the tornado hit lost most exterior walls and the entire roof, except for the roof over the attached garage, which was on the north side of the house. It also destroyed a second garage on the property and then completely destroyed a mobile home across the street. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds around 150mph at this location. The tornado continued north-northeastward, destroying a barn, pushing an unanchored home off its foundation and completely destroying another mobile home. This mobile home was partially anchored by wood posts set in slots on a concrete foundation over a basement and crawl space. The resident of this home was badly injured and was found unconscious, trapped under debris in the crawl space. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 140mph at this location. As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic.  The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST.  In total, the tornado impacted 506 structures...including major damage to 61 homes and 7 businesses and complete destruction of 28 homes.  Total damage was estimated at $118.9 million.</div>`)[0];

Minor roof damage to a nearby two story home also occurred.  As the tornado tracked northeast across the eastern side of downtown Columbus, MS, it became evident that the storm had grown in strength a bit as streets became littered with uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees, many of which had fallen on homes, causing significant roof damage. As the tornado moved along 9th street and College Street, damage was noted on top of a cell tower, where portions of the metal structure was evidently bent. By the time the tornado reached 12th Street and 4th Avenue, more extensive damage was noted by way of a brick fence along a single family home getting almost completely destroyed and additional snapped and uprooted hardwood trees.  Wooden power lines were snapped near or at its base at 12th Street and 4th Avenue, where portions of the roof was loss at the nearby Canterbury Townhouses. Littered downed and snapped trees falling on top of homes persisted along the northeast side of downtown Columbus, and southward facing homes along Railroad Street had windows that were blown out. As the tornado continued along its northeast path, it intersected the Hunt Intermediate School along 10th Avenue and 20th Street resulting in significant damage to the roof, and blown out windows along the second floor. Across the street, the Park and Rec Center and Activities Center composed of metal and tin were blown in/collapsed on its entry side. Damage continued along Tuscaloosa Road by way of fence damage along the outskirts of a Loves Truck Stop and snapped softwood and hardwood trees behind the Loves Truck Stop.  The First Pentecostal Church along Tuscaloosa Road had half of its tin roof blown off, and thus resulted in damage done to the inside of its worship area. At the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Conway Road, several manufactured buildings had most of its exterior walls and roofs caved in. The one fatality occurred at the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Gardner Street, where a structural sound brick building collapsed and the majority of the exterior walls were destroyed.  This tornado began to weaken as it neared the Alabama state line, as several softwood medium size tree limbs and snapped softwood trees occurred north of Highway 50. This tornado lifted just as it crossed state lines into Alabama. Maximum estimated winds were 137 mph.</div>`)[0];

Extensive damage occurred to a two-story home. The Humble Zion Church which was completely demolished with no walls left standing, was constructed of cinder blocks and mortar. The tornado continued east northeast along or just south of Highway 315, and weakened once again with EF1 wind damage found through forested areas in and around the highway as it crossed Callier Road, O'Neal Road, and Mitchell Road.

The tornado intensified again as it crossed Washington Avenue, the main north-south road through town, causing EF2 damage. A few manufactured homes were completely turned over, twisted, and destroyed. Contents of the homes were blown over a quarter mile into the woods behind them. One site-built, single family home was twisted at least 10 feet off of it's foundation and another |had its second story completely removed. Two apartment buildings were completely blown down with the foundation slabs laid bare. At least a dozen cars were destroyed by wind-blown debris. Several cars were blown several feet from where they were parked and one sedan was rolled up onto the top of a small pick-up truck. Several other manufactured homes lost portions of their roofing and some lost whole rooms to the winds. Seven injuries were reported in Talbotton. The tornado continued east northeast out of Talbotton, continuing to snap and uproot hundreds of trees along the path. Another manufactured home was found to have been displaced and torn apart, with another having its rear half collapsed from winds and falling trees. The storm continued moving to the east northeast between Highway 80 and Boot Kelly and Pobiddy Roads. On Poplar Cross Road, between Pobiddy Road and Highway 80, hundreds of softwood trees were snapped near their bases. The tornado dissipated just east of the intersection of George Smith Road and Carl Mathis Road. Seven injuries were reported along the Talbot County portion of the tornado path.

It continued northeast, crossing South Maple Street where the tornado intensified, resulting in widespread tree damage just south of Highway 3012 along Wade Drive, Lind Drive, Robert Street, University Boulevard, and Shelor Drive. Many of these streets were impassable due to the significant number of trees snapped, twisted, and uprooted. Many more trees were downed on Highway 3012 before the tornado tracked northeast towards Westwood Drive. It uprooted a number of trees onto fraternity houses before it crossed the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The tornado crossed the railroad and bent or uprooted several large light poles on Louisiana Tech's softball, baseball, and neighboring athletic fields. It snapped a number of power poles as well. The tornado crossed Tech Drive and damaged a number of dormitories where it removed their metal roofs and blew out windows. It continued northeast where it uprooted more trees on Louisiana Tech's and Ruston High School's campuses. The estimated winds as the tornado tore through the western and northern sections of Louisiana Tech University ranged from 115-130 mph. The tornado crossed Greenwood Cemetery where it intensified again, resulting in a large number of trees being debarked with just the stubs of the large branches remaining in several areas. It continued with several business sustaining significant damage to their exterior brick walls and some interior walls. A hotel along Interstate 20 suffered the collapse of its top story's exterior walls. The tornado continued on to severely damage a gas station between Trenton and Vienna Streets just south of I-20, before crossing the interstate and weakened slightly but still resulted in considerable roof damage to several businesses along North Service Road East. The tornado then began to weaken, with more sporadic wind damage noted as it moved northeast towards Farmerville Highway. It crossed Farmerville Highway near Timberline Court uprooting a number of trees and continued northeast towards Haddox Road. The tornado then lifted and touched back down a few more times with the intermittent damage noted for the rest of its path. It uprooted a few more trees along Stable and Baxter Roads, destroyed a chicken house along Highway 820, before finally lifting just south of Oak Tree Road. The tornado resulted in two fatalities when a tree fell through their home, killing a 35 year old female and her 14 year old son just south of Interstate 20 in Ruston.</div>`)[0];

The aerial survey of this tornado revealed a clearly defined path. Numerous power poles were broken. The survey also showed pump jacks and other oil field equipment that were toppled by the tornado. The tornado had a lifespan of 15 minutes. Based on research that occurred in association with the May 14, 2010 Notrees tornado, a tornado that also knocked down oil field pump jacks, this tornado was rated as an EF-3 tornado.
